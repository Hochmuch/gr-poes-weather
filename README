gr-poes-weather GNURadio package contain few deframer and decoder block's for weather satellite telemetry reception 
I have used Patrik Tast package and add few new blocks, for example CADU deframing for MetOp satellite or universally 
deframer with setable frame length for NOAA HRPT.
 

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.
It also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.


To build and install use these commands:
  .. uninstall and then backup the folder with old gr-poes-weather package when present on your machine
  
  .. cd to new gr-poes-weather directory and do next steps
  
  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install
  $ ldconfig
